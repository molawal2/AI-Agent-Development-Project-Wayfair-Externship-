# AI Agent Creation Using n8n – Wayfair Externship

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates building a small AI agent using n8n as part of my Wayfair externship. The AI agent tracks data, applies logic, and generates automated messages based on input conditions.

## Key Features
- Built a workflow in n8n that processes input data and applies logic.
- Created conditional outcomes based on data (e.g., sunny vs. rainy weather).
- Developed understanding of automation logic, decision-making, and workflow management in AI tools.

## Workflow Diagram
Here’s a visual representation of the AI agent workflow:https://github.com/molawal2/AI-Agent-Development-Project-Wayfair-Externship-/blob/AI-2.PNG/AI%202.PNG

## Technologies Used
- n8n (automation tool)
- Logic nodes and code nodes
- Conditional branching (If nodes)
- Set nodes for message output

## Outcome
- Created a functioning AI agent that reacts to input data with dynamic outputs.
- Gained hands-on experience in building AI-driven automations for business scenarios.
