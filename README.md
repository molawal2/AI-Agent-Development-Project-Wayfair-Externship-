# AI Agent Creation Using n8n – Wayfair Externship

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the development of a small AI-driven automation using **n8n** as part of my Wayfair AI Externship. The AI agent processes input data, applies decision logic, and generates automated responses based on conditions.

---

## Key Features
- Built an end-to-end workflow in n8n that simulates data input and applies logic.  
- Implemented conditional branching for different automated outputs (e.g., sunny vs. rainy responses).  
- Gained hands-on experience in workflow automation, decision-making, and building lightweight AI agents.

## Technologies Used
- **n8n** (workflow automation tool)  
- Code nodes for custom JSON data  
- IF/conditional logic nodes  
- Set nodes for dynamic message output  

---

## Outcome
- Created a functioning AI-style automation that reacts dynamically to input data.  
- Strengthened practical skills in AI automation, workflow orchestration, and no-code/low-code tools used in enterprise environments.
